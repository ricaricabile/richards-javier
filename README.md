This is my personal website I used react, styled components, semantic UI and native css and for statemanagement I used react-redux for front end and for the backend I used Node with express

To run application locally go to 
**Root Folder**
enter
**npm install**
next go to the client folder
and enter
**npm install**
wait for each npm commands to finish installing 
then go back to the root Folder
then enter
**npm run dev**
